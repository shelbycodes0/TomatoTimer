# TomatoTimer
Python/Tkinter Pomodoro Timer App

Are you easily distracted?
I know that I can be.

This little tomato timer üçÖ is based on the Pomodoro Technique which is supposed to help limit external distractions and help with focus and flow.
Basically you work undistracted for 25 mins and then reward yourself with a little 5 min break. 
After 4 rounds of this, you get a long break of 20-30 mins. 
I'm going to start using my timer while working on practice problems on HackerRank and see if it helps me focus. üòä

I made it with Python and the Tkinter package.

I am also using this as a prototype to convert it to a web application with more features.
